This is an explorory analysis of the Digimon Database Kaggle Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/digidb). 

I was interested in understanding what are the primary factors that determine niche picking in Digimon. 

Here is the line of inquiry that I pursued: 

1) What attributes of Digimon are correlated? Do magic-using Digimon have higher spirit? 

2) Are there specific categories of Digimon that are more adapted to the "magic-user" niche? If so do each of the Digimon occupy a different niche? 

3) Does the stage of evolution act confound correlations between different variables? 

4) What drives niche picking in Digimon?
