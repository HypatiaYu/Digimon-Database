This is an explorory analysis of the Digimon Database Kaggle Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/digidb). 

The main questions I had were the following: 

1) What attributes of Digimon are correlated? Do magic-using Digimon have higher spirit? 

2) Are there specific categories of Digimon that are more adapted to the "magic-user" niche? If so do each of the Digimon occupy a different niche? 

3) If so, how does this influence the strategy we use against them?
